In this file I'll be writing down some ideas about projects I could do to apply what I learned. I probably will also add ideas that are somewhat related to the topic. 
Some of them are going to be my own, but they'll mostly be either things I talked with friends, found online, or know that they have been done and just want to try 
recreating them.

Ideas:
* Visualizer of daily 'top' stocks (according to different, simple metrics)
* Basic investing helper: A computer program that analyzes different stocks and tells you which one to invest on (credits @JaelAguilar). 
As it definitely won't be very good at first, I wouldn't actually use it but the idea is to 'pretend' like I did and see what the results would have been. 
I could also use historical values just to see its predictions.
* Compound Interest/Mortgage/etc. Calculator
* Budget organizer. I have an excel where I usually put all my financial info and it would be nice if I could add some features to it and automatize it.
