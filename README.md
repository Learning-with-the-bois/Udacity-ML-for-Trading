# Udacity-ML-for-Trading
This repository contains my progress on the Udacity course Machine Learning for Trading by Georgia Tech. I plan on submitting my notes, any related code, and exercises I do throughout the course.

I'll submit some quizzes as well. If you want to do the course, avoid them so you don't get spoilers.
