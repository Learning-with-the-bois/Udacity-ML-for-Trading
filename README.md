# Udacity-ML-for-Trading
This repository contains my progress on the Udacity course "Machine Learning for Trading" by Georgia Tech. I plan on submitting my notes, any related code, and exercises I do throughout the course.

I'll submit some quizzes as well. If you want to do the course, avoid them so you don't get spoilers. Also, some won't run as they require files to be read that I probably won't upload.

*** This means a big portion of those activities will come from code I did not make but rather just finished. So, it is not of my creation. ***
