# Udacity-ML-for-Trading
This repository contains my progress on the Udacity course "Machine Learning for Trading" by Georgia Tech. I plan on submitting my notes, any related code, and exercises I do throughout the course. 

I am also hoping to try to think of ways to apply my knowledge by creating mini projects (I noticed there's actually 8 projects on the course website, so I could try those as well), so feel free to make any suggestions! 

On my notes I have a bit of a description on how I solved the quizzes, to be honest, they are straightforward so my comments shouldn't give much more insight, but keep it in mind and try to avoid them if you give my notes a look.
